Xcode 4 Templates
=================

A set of custom Xcode 4 compatible file and project templates for using the Cinder and openFrameworks opensource C++ libraries.


Installation
------------

Xcode 4 looks in three locations for templates:

	/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/
	/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/
	~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/

In order to prevent your custom templates from being overwritten by future Xcode updates they should be placed in
	
	~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/
